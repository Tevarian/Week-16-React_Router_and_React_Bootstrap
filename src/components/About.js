        <h1>What's the story of a funny angle?</h1>

          Many years ago when the Internet was fairly new I did freelance web
          design. My roommate and I built a home theater - Dolby Pro Logic was
          the best back then - with VHS, LaserDisc, and a Sony Trinitron where
          we watched all of the movies we could get our hands on. Upon the
          advent of DVD we upgraded to Dolby Digital with a custom subwoofer.

          Our other hobby was playing Everquest way too much. With our Pentium
          IIIs and CRT monitors using dial up it was the pinacle of modern
          gaming. Our house was a high tech fest on a budget. One of the early
          websites I built was an equipment guide for EQ players called The
          Armory. It was mainly just giant tables of equipment specs with screen
          shots, but it was pretty handy for a while.

          After I built that site we decided to try and create a movie review
          site focusing on humorous reviews written by me and my roommate. One
          of our favotire movies at the time was Snatch, and I found the scene
          where Tyrone backs into another vehicle pretty funny. His excuse was
          that the vehicle was "at a funny angle" and I thought that it would
          work well as a site name with it having a dual meaning. Unfortunately
          I had no idea how to deal with user data entry so the site was
          terrible.

          With all of the new skills this class has given me I am sure I could
          extend many of my old projects into modern, viable sites. It has been
          a fun and interesting class and I wish I had more time for revisiting
          these projects. I do intend to work on a few projects for my job using
          what I have learned. I am excided to get started!
